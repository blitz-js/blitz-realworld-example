## Design Brief

### What are we designing and building? 
A starting data architecture for integrating planning surveys and job creation tools using environmental and local economics data.
__________________________________________________________________________________

### What is our goal? 
To create widgets that combine local environmental and product data within interfaces that inspire and create new job opportunites.
___________________________________________________________________________________

### Who is our target audience?
All ages. Our interfaces will show simple info by default, with expansion into complex scientific details based on age and experience.
____________________________________________________________________________________

### Whatâ€™s the desired look and feel of the site? 
<!--(e.g., modern, photographs vs illustrations, clean, minimalistic, professional, fun, etc.)-->
We'll have different impact label themes including landscapes, Marvel, and Last Airbender.
____________________________________________________________________________________

### Any specific functionality needed?
Survey submission using Real World example sites and BrightID for unique identities. On mobile, the phone ID will provide uniqueness.

We're focused on equitable, healthy, open data sharing with strong privacy protection for realtime wealth creation.
